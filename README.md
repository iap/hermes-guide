# Hermes Guide

> **Package / slug:** `hermes-guide`

Hermes usage and self-diagnosis guide for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). **It complements — not replaces — Hermes's built-in diagnostics** (`hermes doctor`, `hermes verify`, and the platform helpers): it is an extra layer covering what they don't. It ships two things:

1. **A plugin** — `/hermes-doctor` (in-session) and `hermes guide` (terminal): read-only diagnostics across config, mcp, skills, commands, hooks, plugins, and memories (each a valid scope).
2. **Ten troubleshooting skills** — teach an agent how to locate and fix each surface, plus venv, auth, and memory guides.

## Install the plugin

```bash
hermes plugins install iap/hermes-guide --enable
```

This clones the repo from GitHub and enables it. To pin an immutable commit:

```bash
hermes plugins install iap/hermes-guide --ref <40-char-SHA> --enable
```

### Manual install

Alternatively, clone this repo directly into your Hermes plugins directory:

```bash
# POSIX / WSL: $HERMES_HOME is ~/.hermes
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iap/hermes-guide ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-guide
hermes plugins enable hermes-guide
```

A clone (rather than `cp -r .`) keeps VCS metadata and local caches out of the plugin directory. On native Windows `$HERMES_HOME` is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` (not `~/.hermes`); run `hermes config path` to confirm.

## Usage

- In a session: `/hermes-doctor` (all surfaces) or `/hermes-doctor mcp` (one surface).
- In a terminal: `hermes guide` — exits `1` if any surface is broken or unknown (indeterminate), and `2` for an unrecognized scope name.

### Proactive mode (opt-in)

Add to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  entries:
    hermes-guide:
      settings:
        proactive: true
```

Drift findings are then logged at session start/end — watch `hermes logs --follow`.

## Install the skills (tap)

Installing the plugin (above) does **not** list or install the skills — they ship
as separate, opt-in reference material. To make them appear under `hermes skills`,
add this repo as a skills tap, then install what you want:

```bash
hermes skills tap add iap/hermes-guide
hermes skills install iap/hermes-guide/skills/hermes-configuration-guide
```

The other nine skills use the same `iap/hermes-guide/skills/<name>` form:
`diagnosing-mcp`, `diagnosing-skills`, `diagnosing-commands`, `diagnosing-hooks`, `diagnosing-plugins`, `diagnosing-path`, `diagnosing-cli-tui`, `diagnosing-auth`, `diagnosing-memory`.

> [!NOTE]
> The identifier must include the `skills/` prefix (it is the repo-relative path to the skill's `SKILL.md`). The shorter `iap/hermes-guide/<name>` form does not resolve.

Each installed skill is also available as a slash command (e.g. `/hermes-configuration-guide`).

## What's included

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hermes-configuration-guide` | The map: resolving `$HERMES_HOME`, where each surface is configured, instruction files, orphaned/legacy settings, and routing to the diagnostic skills |
| `diagnosing-mcp` | MCP servers that won't connect, expose no tools, fail OAuth, or ignore `mcp_servers:` config |
| `diagnosing-skills` | Skills not discovered, shadowed, hidden by platform/toolset conditions, or stuck "user-modified" |
| `diagnosing-commands` | Missing or overridden slash commands — skills-as-commands, bundles, plugin commands, per-platform permissions |
| `diagnosing-hooks` | Hooks that don't fire — the four hook systems, shell-hook consent, `hermes hooks doctor` |
| `diagnosing-plugins` | Plugins that don't load — the `plugins.enabled` gate, capability consent, discovery locations |
| `diagnosing-path` | Path issues — the dual-venv layout (.venv/venv), detection, canonical resolution order, cross-platform best practices |
| `diagnosing-cli-tui` | CLI/TUI issues on native Windows — rendering artifacts, themes, busy indicators, mouse modes, encoding, launch/resume |
| `diagnosing-auth` | Hub-install auth failures — dead/shadowing `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the profile `.env`, `gh-cli` fallback, 401 vs anonymous probes, rate-limit verdicts |
| `diagnosing-memory` | Memory problems — built-in `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md` stores, external providers configured but silently unavailable, missing plugins/keys, char-limit and approval gates |

## Design principle

**Complement, don't duplicate.** When a built-in (`hermes doctor`, `hermes verify`, per-surface helpers) already answers the question, use it — hermes-guide exists for the gaps: deep per-surface troubleshooting playbooks, deterministic read-only health checks, and the routing map between surfaces. If a check here ever starts duplicating a built-in, the built-in wins and the check gets trimmed.

Every diagnosis resolves to a concrete action: a `hermes <subcommand>` command or a specific file + field edit, then a `/reload-*` or restart to apply.

## Contributing

Skills track the Hermes Agent source and its shipped documentation (`website/docs/` in `hermes-agent`). When Hermes changes behavior, update the affected skill and bump its `version`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

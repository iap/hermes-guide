# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to hermes-guide!

## What this project is

hermes-guide is a [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) plugin + skills tap. The plugin (`plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py`/`checks.py`/`constants.py`) ships read-only diagnostics (`/hermes-doctor` and `hermes guide`), and the `skills/` directory bundles thirteen SKILL.md files that teach configuration and troubleshooting for MCP, skills, commands, hooks, plugins, hub auth, memory, paths/venvs, the Windows CLI/TUI, the desktop app, and model providers.

## Reporting Issues

If a skill contains inaccurate guidance for a specific Hermes version, or is missing a known pitfall, please [open an issue](https://github.com/iap/hermes-guide/issues).

## Branch Naming

Short-lived branches, prefixed by type. Branch → merge to `master` → delete; never keep long-lived category buckets.

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `fix/` | Defects (wrong behavior), e.g. `fix/mcp-key-constants` |
| `feat/` | Enhancements and refactors, e.g. `feat/plugin-hardening` |
| `docs/` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style/` | Formatting, no behavior change |
| `refactor/` | Same behavior, different structure |
| `perf/` | Performance improvements |
| `test/` | Tests |
| `chore/` | CI, deps, build tooling |
| `ci/` | CI workflow changes (may overlap `chore/`; prefer `ci/` when the change is workflow-only) |

Add a new prefix only when you actually need it.

## Commit Messages

Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): summary`

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `fix` | Defects |
| `feat` | Enhancements |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `style` | Formatting |
| `refactor` | Same behavior, different structure |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `test` | Tests |
| `ci` | CI workflow changes |
| `chore` | CI, deps, build |

Scope is the affected surface (`mcp`, `checks`, `config`, `skills`, `hooks`, `plugins`, `ci`, `deps`).

Examples:
- `fix(mcp): correct key constants for OAuth flow`
- `docs(agents): add venv path convention rule`
- `feat(guide): add diagnosing-path skill`

## Skill naming convention

- `diagnosing-<surface>` for diagnostic skills (e.g. `diagnosing-mcp`, `diagnosing-path`).
- `hermes-` prefix reserved for the configuration map skill (`hermes-configuration-guide`).
- Kebab-case, lowercase, ≤20 characters. The configuration map skill
  (`hermes-configuration-guide`, 26 chars) predates this limit and is exempt;
  every `diagnosing-*` name must fit it.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b fix/diagnosing-mcp-oauth`).
3. Edit or add SKILL.md files under `skills/<name>/`, and/or the plugin files (`plugin.yaml`, `__init__.py`, `checks.py`, `constants.py`).
4. Verify frontmatter parses (valid YAML between `---` fences, `name`, `description`, `version`).
5. Run `python -m py_compile __init__.py checks.py constants.py`, `hermes plugins doctor . --ci`, and the guard linters + regression tests in `tools/` (see the checklist in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)).
6. Cross-check every `hermes <subcommand>` reference against the installed Hermes docs or `--help` output.
7. Commit with a descriptive message and open a pull request.

## Content Guidelines

- Every diagnosis must resolve to a concrete action: a `hermes <subcommand>` or a specific file + field edit, then `/reload-*` or restart.
- Use GitHub alert callouts where they genuinely help readers:
  - `> [!NOTE]` — context not to miss
  - `> [!TIP]` — optional shortcut
  - `> [!IMPORTANT]` — required for success
  - `> [!WARNING]` — breakage or data loss risk
  - `> [!CAUTION]` — irreversible action (e.g., deleting config, removing a plugin)
- Hermes configuration is YAML (`config.yaml`), never JSON.
- `$HERMES_HOME` is `~/.hermes` on POSIX, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on native Windows. Teach `hermes config path` as ground truth.
- When Hermes changes behavior, update the affected skill(s) and bump their `version`.
- See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full set of agent instructions and false-positive hazards to avoid.

## Writing style

Describe behavior — don't assert quality. Docs should say what the plugin and skills *do*, not how good they are.

- ✅ "Skills track the Hermes source"
- ✅ "Checks report malformed bundles, missing plugins, and slug collisions"
- ❌ "The most reliable, fully accurate guide to Hermes"

CI enforces this with a self-claim guard over all Markdown files (`tools/check_self_claim.py`). The deny-list lives in that script. If it trips, reword the line to a factual description of behavior.
